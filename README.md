# Primitive Recursive Simulator
This website allows you to simulate primitive recursive functions by defining functions using primitive recursion and the successor s(n)=n+1


### Please note ###
- This is still in an early state of development.
- I primarily created this for my own to try out some things.
- Structure, design and commenting of code is a in bit unpleasant state.
- I did not implement any stack optimization yet, so you should expect a stack overflow for complex functions.
- If you have any improvements, feel free to create a pull request.
